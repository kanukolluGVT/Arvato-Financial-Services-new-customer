**Arvato-MLProject**

In this project, I have worked on 4 demographics datasets provided Arvato Financial Services, with the intermediary goal of extracting similarities/differences between the general population and the current customer base of a German-based company, in order to predict which individuals are more likely to become new customers (individuals who could then be targeted by the mail-order company campaign).

This project employs both unsupervised (PCA and Dimensionality Reduction, k-Means Clustering and Customer Segmentation) and supervised (from scikit-learn...) machine learning algorithms and techniques.
